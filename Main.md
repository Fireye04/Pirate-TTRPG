# Pirate Game

## Brainstorming

- One GM
- Multiple players, each plays an officer on the ship.
- One player plays the captain
- want the level of exhaustion to effect risk in some way
- Spend one exhaustion to gain a single D6 in your roll pool
- Spend one exhaustion to gain an FX POINT
- FX POINTS can be spent within a roll and spent on DM provided options or a card draw.

- fast experience progression; aim for quick snappy stories, that end in retirement, mutiny, or death, then new characters are rolled and start it all again.
  - deincentivise long standing characters- Aging mechanics!!

Each officer has a set of cards. These cards represent their capacity to exceed the average person's abilities.

Cards are used to initiate actions. The value of the card is the number each player must role a d12 beneath in order to success. Face cards all count as 10, and aces count as 1 or 11, player's choice. The suit of the card represents the type of failure

Hearts => Emotional Failure (hurt someones feelings, hurt your own feelings, etc)
Diamond => ???  
Spades => ???
Clubs => Physical failture (break something, hit someone, etc)

### Day Mechanics

At the start of the day each player removes 3 exhaustion and draws 10 cards.

### Skills

Players each have a set of skills that provide bonuses to rolls. Each skill has various levels of expertise that players can benefit from.

Whenever a check is failed, one skill point is gained. Each level of a skill has a different skill point cost, increasing with level.

### Abilities

Abilities are great feats of pirate legend that players can unlock instead of skills using skill points. Different abilities will require varying levels of skill before they can be unlocked. Using abilities usually incurs a hefty cost on the pirate, however they allow players to do things that they otherwise couldn't

### Checks

At any point the GM can call for a check. Each check has an associated skill

Checks involved spending one or more card from the players hand and a dice role. To pass a check the player role below the value of a played card. To increase the probability of passing a check, players can play multiple cards and role against their sum.

If a player has no cards in their hand or does not wish to spend a card from their hand to complete a check they can take a BASE ACTION. When performing a check with a BASE ACTION the player must role below (6 - Exhaustion) to pass. Taking a BASE ACTION adds a single point of exhaustion (draw a face down card) after rolling.

### Exhaustion

Face down cards drawn in front of a player represent **exhaustion**. Exhaustion effects all roles and represents the players temper. For each exhaustion, reduce the value of all played cards by 1 (e.g. a player playing a 8 with 3 exhaustion will need to role under 5 in order to pass the check).

### Combat

Ships have health points. Cannons deal damage based on a dice roll (e.g. meduim cannons deal 1d8).

### Actions

Actions can be passed / failed based on checks. Actions are composed of a base action and an intent.

Examples

- Navigation with intent to align for combat
- Navigation with intent to get somewhere fast
- Navigation with intent to get somewhere steathly

Not sure how I feel about intent TBH --- might make more sense to have these as seperate rolls, etc.

### Check Difficulty

For each check dice players role a pool of dice. The lowest valued dice is the value used for the check.

- Hard checks => 1d12
- Medium checks => 2d12
- Easy check => 3d12

Players can additionally push themselves on a roll, costing them one point of exhaustion. In exchange, they may choose one of the following

- Add 1d6 to your dice pool.

- | Check | Effect |
  | ----- | ------ |
