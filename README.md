## Running icepool

This repo also features a dice probability calculator for the RNG systems. `python3` and `pip` are required (`make` is helpful, but not necessary), and this has only been tested on linux. To play around with it, you can do the following:

1. Clone the repo and cd into it.
2. Run `make init`
3. Run `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. `python3 main.py` will run the program, edit main.py's main method to tweak what graphs you want to make. The `drawGraphs()` function takes a 2d array, which tells the program where each graph should be rendered.
